## 🛣️ **Next Development Phase: Database Integration**

### **Step 1: Database Setup** 🗄️

**Learning Goal:** Understand database design and ORM usage

```bash
# 1. Install Prisma ORM
npm install prisma @prisma/client
npx prisma init

# 2. Configure PostgreSQL connection
# 3. Design database schema
# 4. Run initial migration
# 5. Test database connection
```

**Tables to create:**
- 👤 Users (id, email, password, name, created_at)
- 📄 Resumes (id, user_id, filename, s3_url, created_at)
- 💼 Jobs (id, user_id, company, position, status, applied_at)

### **Step 2: Authentication System** 🔐

**Learning Goal:** Implement secure user authentication

```bash
# 1. JWT token generation and validation
# 2. Password hashing with bcryptjs
# 3. Login/register endpoints
# 4. Auth middleware for protected routes
# 5. Frontend auth context integration
```

**Endpoints to build:**
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - User logout
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user
- `PUT /api/auth/profile` - Update profile

### **Step 3: File Upload System** 📁

**Learning Goal:** Handle file uploads with cloud storage

```bash
# 1. Configure AWS S3 bucket
# 2. Implement Multer middleware
# 3. File validation and processing
# 4. Progress tracking
# 5. Error handling for uploads
```

**Features to build:**
- Resume file upload (PDF/DOC/DOCX)
- File size and type validation
- Progress indicators
- Cloud storage integration
- File management (delete, replace)

### **Step 4: CRUD Operations** 📊

**Learning Goal:** Build complete API functionality

```bash
# 1. Job application CRUD operations
# 2. Resume management CRUD
# 3. Search and filtering
# 4. Status updates and tracking
# 5. Data validation and sanitization
```

**API Endpoints:**
- Jobs: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE `/api/jobs`
- Resumes: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE `/api/resumes`
- Search: GET `/api/search` with query parameters
