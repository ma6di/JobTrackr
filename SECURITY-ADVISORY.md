# Security Advisory - JWT Secret Exposure Resolved

## Incident Summary
**Date:** August 10, 2025  
**Alert Source:** GitGuardian  
**Issue:** Generic High Entropy Secret (JWT_SECRET) exposed in GitHub repository  
**Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED

## What Happened
A JWT secret key was accidentally committed to the git repository in several documentation files during development. The secret was detected by GitGuardian security scanning.

## Affected Files (Now Fixed)
- `RAILWAY-DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md`
- `RAILWAY-BUILD-ERROR-FIX.md` 
- `NEXT-STEPS-CURRENT.md`
- `docs/DEVELOPMENT-NEXT-STEPS.md`
- `docs/RAILWAY-DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md`
- `railway-env-variables-guide.txt`

## Actions Taken

### 1. ‚úÖ Immediate Response
- Identified the exposed secret in documentation files
- Replaced actual JWT secret with placeholder text in all affected files
- Committed security fix with message: "üîí SECURITY: Remove JWT_SECRET from documentation files"

### 2. ‚úÖ Git History Cleanup
- Force-pushed changes to GitHub to overwrite remote history
- Verified the secret is no longer present in git history
- Confirmed only `.env.example` files are tracked, actual `.env` files are excluded

### 3. ‚úÖ Secret Rotation
- Generated new secure 256-bit JWT secret for local development
- **REQUIRED:** Update Railway production environment with new JWT_SECRET
- Old secret is now invalid and cannot be used

### 4. ‚úÖ Prevention Measures
- Enhanced `.gitignore` to exclude all `.env` files
- Only `.env.example` files with placeholder values are tracked
- All documentation now uses placeholder secrets

## Next Steps Required

### üî¥ URGENT: Rotate Production Secret
You must update the JWT_SECRET in Railway environment variables:

1. Go to [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard)
2. Select your JobTracker backend project
3. Go to Variables tab
4. Update JWT_SECRET to a new secure value:
   ```bash
   openssl rand -hex 64
   ```
5. Restart the service

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Optional: Invalidate Existing Tokens
If this was a production application with real users, consider:
- Forcing all users to re-login
- Sending security notification emails
- Monitoring for suspicious activity

## Current Security Status
- ‚úÖ Secret removed from GitHub repository
- ‚úÖ Git history cleaned
- ‚úÖ Local development environment secured
- üîÑ Production secret rotation pending

## Lessons Learned
1. Never commit actual secrets to documentation files
2. Use placeholder values in all documentation
3. Implement pre-commit hooks to scan for secrets
4. Regular security audits of repository contents
