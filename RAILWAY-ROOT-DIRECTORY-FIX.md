# 🚨 RAILWAY ROOT DIRECTORY FIX - VISUAL GUIDE

## Problem: Railway is scanning the wrong folder!

**What Railway sees now:**
```
./  (ROOT - WRONG!)
├── JobTracker/
├── JobTracker-Backend/  ← This is what we want!
├── .DS_Store
├── AUTHENTICATION-ISSUES-FIXED.md
├── EXPERIENCE-LEVEL-FINAL-STATUS.md
... (all the markdown files)
```

**What Railway should see:**
```
JobTracker-Backend/  (CORRECT!)
├── package.json
├── src/
├── prisma/
├── node_modules/
├── railway.json
├── nixpacks.toml
... (Node.js project files)
```

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Fix

### Step 1: Go to Railway Settings
1. Open Railway dashboard
2. Click on your service
3. Click **"Settings"** tab (gear icon)

### Step 2: Find Source Configuration
Look for a section called:
- **"Source"** or
- **"Repository"** or  
- **"GitHub Integration"**

### Step 3: Set Root Directory
- Find field labeled **"Root Directory"** or **"Source Directory"**
- **Current value:** probably empty or `./`
- **Change to:** `JobTracker-Backend`
- **Click "Update" or "Save"**

### Step 4: Force Redeploy
- Go to **"Deployments"** tab
- Click **"Deploy Now"** or **"Redeploy"**
- Watch build logs - should now detect Node.js!

## 🎯 Expected Result After Fix

Build logs should show:
```
✅ Detected Node.js project
✅ Found package.json
✅ Installing dependencies...
✅ Running npm run build
✅ Starting with npm start
```

## 🚨 If Settings Don't Have Root Directory Option

**Delete and recreate service:**
1. Delete current Railway service
2. Create new: **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
3. **DURING SETUP:** Set root directory to `JobTracker-Backend`
4. Complete setup with PostgreSQL

## 💡 Why This Happened

Railway tried to auto-detect project type from repository root, but found:
- No `package.json` at root
- Lots of markdown files
- Multiple project folders
- Couldn't determine what to build

Setting root directory tells Railway: **"Only look at this folder!"**

**This fix should resolve the Railpack error immediately!** 🚀
