# ðŸ”§ NO ROOT DIRECTORY OPTION - SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

## Problem
Railway interface doesn't show "Root Directory" option, so we can't tell it to only scan `JobTracker-Backend/`.

## Solution Applied
âœ… **Created `/railway.json` at repository root** with these instructions for Railway:

```json
{
  "build": {
    "buildCommand": "cd JobTracker-Backend && npm ci && npm run build",
    "watchPatterns": ["JobTracker-Backend/**"]
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "cd JobTracker-Backend && npm start"
  }
}
```

## What This Does
- **`cd JobTracker-Backend`** - Changes to the correct directory
- **`npm ci && npm run build`** - Installs deps and builds the app
- **`npm start`** - Starts the server from the backend directory
- **`watchPatterns`** - Only watches backend files for changes

## Next Steps
1. âœ… **File created and pushed to GitHub**
2. ðŸš€ **Go to Railway â†’ Deployments â†’ "Deploy Now"**
3. ðŸ“‹ **Railway should now:**
   - Detect it as Node.js project
   - Build from JobTracker-Backend directory
   - Start the server correctly

## Expected Build Log
```
âœ… Detected Node.js project
âœ… Running: cd JobTracker-Backend && npm ci
âœ… Installing dependencies...
âœ… Running: npm run build
âœ… Starting: cd JobTracker-Backend && npm start
```

**Try the deployment again now!** ðŸš€
