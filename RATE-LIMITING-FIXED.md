## âœ… Rate Limiting Issue Fixed

The "Too many requests" (429) error has been resolved by updating the backend server configuration.

### ðŸ”§ **CHANGES MADE:**

1. **Updated Rate Limiting Configuration:**
   - **Before:** 100 requests per 15 minutes (very restrictive)
   - **After:** 1000 requests per minute (very lenient for development)

2. **Development Mode Detection:**
   - Rate limiting is now **disabled in development** mode
   - Only applies in production environments
   - Added console log when rate limiting is disabled

3. **Server Restart:**
   - Stopped old server process
   - Started new server with updated configuration

### ðŸ“Š **BEFORE vs AFTER:**

**Before:**
```json
{
  "error": "Too many requests from this IP, please try again later.",
  "retryAfter": "15 minutes"
}
```

**After:**
- âœ… No more 429 rate limiting errors
- âœ… Normal API responses (200, 401, etc.)
- âœ… Development-friendly limits

### ðŸ§ª **VERIFICATION:**

âœ… **Health endpoint:** Working (200 response)
âœ… **API endpoints:** Working (proper 401 auth error instead of 429)
âœ… **Rate limiting:** Disabled in development mode

### ðŸŽ¯ **BENEFITS:**

1. **No More Blocking:** Can make as many API calls as needed during development
2. **Faster Development:** No waiting 15 minutes between tests
3. **Production Ready:** Rate limiting still applies in production mode
4. **Better UX:** Jobs page will load without API errors

### ðŸš€ **NEXT STEPS:**

The Jobs page should now work properly without any rate limiting errors. You can:
- Refresh the Jobs page
- Add new job applications
- Edit existing jobs
- Upload and preview resumes

All API calls should work normally now!
