## 🐛 Match Calculator Debugging Guide

The match calculator was not using real resume data because of several issues:

### 🔧 **FIXES APPLIED:**

1. **Fixed Async State Management** ✅
   - Replaced incorrect `useMemo` with async operations
   - Used `useEffect` + `useState` for proper async handling
   - Added loading state while calculating matches

2. **Added Debug Logging** ✅
   - Console logs show each step of the matching process
   - Resume content extraction is now visible
   - Match calculation details are logged

3. **Updated Table Rendering** ✅
   - Fixed variable name from `jobsWithMatchScores` to `jobsWithScores`
   - Added loading indicator while calculating matches
   - Proper error handling for failed extractions

### 🧪 **TESTING STEPS:**

1. **Open Browser Console** (F12 > Console tab)
2. **Navigate to Jobs Page** (http://localhost:5173/jobs)
3. **Look for Debug Messages:**
   ```
   🔍 extractResumeContent called with: [resume object]
   📡 Making API call to preview resume: [id]
   📄 Extracted text content: [first 200 chars]...
   🎯 calculateMatchPercentage called
   🔑 Resume keywords found: [array]
   🎯 Job keywords found: [array]
   ✅ Matched keywords: [array]
   ❌ Missing keywords: [array]
   🎯 Final match percentage: XX%
   ```

### 🔍 **WHAT TO CHECK:**

1. **Resume Content Extraction:**
   - Is actual file content being extracted?
   - Or is fallback content being used?

2. **Keyword Matching:**
   - Are resume keywords being found?
   - Are job keywords being extracted?
   - Are matches being calculated correctly?

3. **API Issues:**
   - Is the backend responding?
   - Are resume files accessible?
   - Any CORS or authentication issues?

### 🚨 **COMMON ISSUES:**

1. **Backend Not Running:**
   ```bash
   cd JobTracker-Backend
   node src/server.js
   ```

2. **Authentication Issues:**
   - User not logged in
   - Token expired
   - CORS problems

3. **File Access Issues:**
   - Resume files not uploaded
   - Wrong file permissions
   - Unsupported file formats

### 📊 **EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:**

- **With Real Resume:** Shows actual keywords from file content
- **With Fallback:** Shows generic technical skills
- **Loading State:** Shows "Calculating match scores..." briefly
- **Match Tooltips:** Show detailed breakdown on hover

### 🎯 **NEXT STEPS:**

1. Check browser console for debug messages
2. Verify API calls are working
3. Test with different file types (TXT, PDF, DOCX)
4. Confirm match percentages are realistic
5. Test tooltip functionality with real data
